**Documentation:** [![crate docs (master)](https://img.shields.io/badge/master-yellow.svg?label=docs)](https://exonum.github.io/pwbox-rs/pwbox/)

`pwbox` crate provides utilities for password-based encryption together with
corresponding composable cryptographic primitives. Using the crate, it is
possible to securely encrypt sensitive data with a password, serialize it
to any `serde`-supported format, and restore data.

**Warning.** Although `pwbox` is constructed analogously to an Ethereum keystore
(and is compatible with it, see crate docs), no independent cryptology expertise has been conducted
regarding its safety. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

See crate documentation for more details how to use the crate.

### Crate Features

- `std` (enabled by default): Enables types from the Rust standard library. Switching
  this feature off can be used for constrained environments, such as WASM. Note that
  the crate still requires an allocator (that is, the `alloc` crate) even
  if the `std` feature is disabled.
- `exonum_sodiumoxide` (enabled by default), `rust-crypto`, `pure` (both disabled by default):
  Provide the cryptographic backends.
